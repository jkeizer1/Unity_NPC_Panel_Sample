# Unity_NPC_Panel_Sample
Unity 5 Project illustrating message panels above NPCs
The project represents a clean starting point for a project with the following features:
- Player as Rigidbody First Person Controller
- Input script to process key board commands; setup just to end the application for ESC
- JK Controller Script; a script designed to be added to any NPC.   User may mouse-select 3d objects and a panel appears above the selected object containing state information. 
- Delegates are used to handle messaging; please see jknotes.com for detailed documentation
